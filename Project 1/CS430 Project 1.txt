CS430 Project 1
Prompt:
Answer the following questions. Source code should be organized, easy to read, and commented sufficiently. You should submit a word document answering the questions (1 point each for 5 points), any source code files (70 points), and a report discussing your implementation (25 points). Note: the programming rubric is out of 100 points. I will follow this then multiply the result by .7 for your programming points.

1. Edgar Allen Poe's 1843 short story, "The Gold Bug", features a cryptanalytic attack. 
What type of cipher is broken and how? 
What happens as a result of this cryptanalytic success? 
2. Find the plaintext and the key of the following ciphertext. Hint: the key is a shift of the alphabet, n.
CSYEVIXIVQMREXIH
3. Write a program to help an analyst decrypt a simple substitution cipher. Your program should take the ciphertext as input, compute letter frequency counts, and display these for the analyst. The program should then allow the analyst to guess a key and display the results of the corresponding "decryption" with the putative key.
4. Use this program to determine the plaintext and key for the ciphertext that appears in the following Alice in Wonderland quote:

5. Decrypt the ciphertext:

IAUTMOCSMNIMREBOTNELSTRHEREOAEVMWIH
TSEEATMAEOHWHSYCEELTTEOHMUOUFEHTRFT
This message was encrypted with a double transposition (of the type discussed in the text) using a matrix of 7 rows and 10 columns.

Hint: The first word is "there." Put the ciphertext in a 7 x 10 array. Then the letters of "there" will all appear (in scrambled order) in one row. This gives a start on the column permutation. Once the column perms are known, the row perms are easily determined.
